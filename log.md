## [2026-08-16] setup | Project instantiated

Empty directory → PlatformIO project + Obsidian vault. Vault root = project root, matching the convention used in the owner's other Projects folders (`index.md` / `log.md` / `CLAUDE.md` at root).

Environment survey found: no PlatformIO installed; system `python3` is **3.14.6** (too new for PlatformIO Core 6.x); the T4-S3 **already connected and enumerating** as `0x303A:0x1001` on `/dev/cu.usbmodem2101`. Installed PlatformIO Core 6.1.19 into a `python3.12` venv at `~/.platformio-venv` ([[D005 - PlatformIO runs on Python 3.12]]).

Flagged and mitigated: the project lives in **iCloud Drive**, which is hostile to a `.pio` build tree (sync storm, file eviction, latency). Build output redirected to `~/.pio-builds/`, library clone kept at `~/.local/src/` ([[D006 - Keep build artifacts out of iCloud]]).

## [2026-08-16] research | Ground truth from the library source

Shallow-cloned `Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-AMOLED-Series` v1.2.4 and read the source rather than the README. Findings that changed the plan:

- **LVGL 8.4.0 confirmed** in both `platformio.ini` and `library.json`. `LV_Helper.cpp` is wrapped in `#if LVGL_VERSION_MAJOR == 8` — under LVGL 9 it compiles to nothing and the link fails. ([[D002 - Pin LVGL to 8.4.0]])
- **There is only one board JSON** for the entire series, `T-Display-AMOLED.json`. Variant selection is a *runtime* call, not a build target. This is why our env is named `T-Display-AMOLED` despite targeting a T4-S3.
- **Rotation 0 is already 600×450 landscape.** `RM690B0_WIDTH = 600`, `RM690B0_HEIGHT = 450`, and `beginAMOLED_241()` ends with `setRotation(0)`. The expected "rotate to landscape" step does not exist. ([[D004 - Rotation 0 is already landscape]])
- **`beginLvglHelper()` already puts the framebuffer in PSRAM** — one full-screen 527 KB `ps_malloc` buffer. The brief's PSRAM requirement is satisfied by the stock path; the DMA variant would actually violate it. ([[D009 - LVGL buffer strategy]])
- **The T4-S3 has no ambient light sensor** (`sensor = NULL` in `BOARD_AMOLED_241`). Day/night dimming must be schedule-driven. ([[D010 - Night dimming is a schedule, not a sensor]])

Recorded 10 decisions and 6 stage notes.

## [2026-08-16] stage-0 | Stock example built, flashed, board confirmed

Built `examples/Factory` from the upstream repo with `platformio.ini` **completely unmodified**, per the brief's Stage 0 rule.

- Build SUCCESS, 3 m 33 s. RAM 19.9 % (65 168 / 327 680 B), Flash 38.1 % (2 498 001 / 6 553 600 B).
- Flash SUCCESS, 2 498 416 B at 963 kbit/s, hash verified.
- Serial: `Board Name:LilyGo AMOLED 2.41 inch` — auto-detect resolved to `LILYGO_AMOLED_241`.
- **Touch confirmed alive**: the library's `Failed to find CST226SE` error is *absent*, so the controller ACKed on I²C.
- Benign errors in the log: 1.47"/1.91" probe misses (that is how auto-detect works), no SD card inserted, and the example's placeholder Wi-Fi credentials.

Toolchain, board config, QIO flash / OPI PSRAM, USB CDC and panel bring-up are all proven. **Held at the Stage 0 gate** pending the owner's visual confirmation that the panel is lit and touch responds — those two cannot be established from a serial log.

## [2026-08-16] stage-1 | Fliqlo layout built and flashed

Owner confirmed the device was connected and asked for the firmware to be flashed, moving past the Stage 0 gate. Built the project's own firmware for the first time.

**Typography was the real problem.** LVGL 8's bundled Montserrat stops at 48 px and an `lv_label` cannot be scaled, so the ~150 px Fliqlo digits had nowhere to come from. Solved by generating a **digits-only 210 px LVGL font** with `lv_font_conv` — ten glyphs, 4 bpp, ~90 KB. It came back with a **tabular advance of 116.8 px identical across all ten digits**, which is what stops the clock from jittering as digits change, and every card dimension now derives from it. ([[D011 - Generate the digit font, do not scale Montserrat]], [[D012 - Card geometry]])

Discovered while reading `lv_conf.h`: the library already sets `LV_MEM_CUSTOM = 1` with `ps_malloc`, so **LVGL's object allocator is on PSRAM too**, not just the framebuffer. And Montserrat 12–48 are all enabled, covering the weather block. No changes to `lv_conf.h` were needed at all.

Build succeeded on the first attempt. RAM 6.8 % (22 140 B), Flash 12.7 % (834 041 B) — a third of Stage 0's image, because Wi-Fi/BLE/SD are not linked yet.

**Hardware confirmed three documented predictions:** `Panel : 600 x 450` with no `setRotation` call ([[D004 - Rotation 0 is already landscape]]); PSRAM fell by exactly **544 640 B** across `beginLvglHelper()` against a predicted 540 000 B ([[D009 - LVGL buffer strategy]]); `Touch : online`. Cold boot to ready in **1397 ms** against a 10 s budget.

Held for the owner's visual check of the layout — proportions, true-black background and digit legibility are not things a serial log can answer.

## [2026-08-16] feature | Abu Dhabi locale + on-device settings, NTP, weather

Owner is in **Abu Dhabi** and asked for a 5-second hold to open a settings screen for timezone, city, brightness "and anything else interesting". That request reshaped the architecture more than it first appears.

**Timezone verified, not assumed.** Checked `Asia/Dubai` against system tzdata in both January and July: UTC+4, **no DST either way**, abbreviation `+04`. The POSIX string is `<+04>-4` — copied from tzdata, not composed. Two traps recorded in [[D015 - Abu Dhabi locale]]: the angle brackets are mandatory (numeric abbreviations are not parseable as POSIX names), and the offset sign is inverted (`-4` means UTC+4).

**`config.h` demoted to first-boot defaults.** A `#define` cannot be edited by a finger, so configuration moved to an NVS-backed `Settings` struct; macros were renamed `DEFAULT_*` so no call site can mistake one for live state. NVS survives re-flashing, so settings are not lost on firmware update. This partially supersedes [[D010 - Night dimming is a schedule, not a sensor]]'s "never persist" stance. ([[D013 - Settings live in NVS, config.h is only defaults]])

**Wi-Fi is now provisioned on the device** — scan, pick, type the password on the on-screen keyboard. `config.h` ships with empty credentials. The owner's password never enters a file, a chat, or a working tree. ([[D016 - Wi-Fi is provisioned on-device]])

**A real bug caught in review before flashing.** Reading `lv_obj_constructor` in LVGL 8.4.0: `obj->flags = LV_OBJ_FLAG_CLICKABLE` is set unconditionally on every object, and `LV_OBJ_FLAG_EVENT_BUBBLE` is *not* among the defaults. The cards, seams, colon dots and weather row would each have swallowed the press, so the 5-second hold would have worked **only in the 14 px margins** — a fault that presents as "the gesture is flaky" and is horrible to diagnose by hand. Fixed with a `decor()` helper applied at all 9 decorative call sites. ([[D014 - Touch hit-testing]])

**Also landed:** Stage 2 (non-blocking Wi-Fi, NTP, the two-phase split-flap fold), Stage 3 (weather on a dedicated FreeRTOS task with capped backoff and a stale dot), and Stage 5 (burn-in walk, tap and long-press) — the last brought forward because it shares the gesture plumbing.

**Log hygiene.** First implementation produced six `ESP_LOGE` lines on a healthy first boot, because Arduino's `Preferences` logs an error for every absent key even when a default is supplied. Six red herrings on a normal boot is what makes a real fault invisible later, so `settings_load()` now probes a sentinel key and seeds NVS instead of reading. Verified: both a virgin boot and a seeded boot emit zero error lines.

Build: RAM 15.5 % (50 720 B), Flash 22.8 % (1 493 757 B). UI up in **1565 ms**.
